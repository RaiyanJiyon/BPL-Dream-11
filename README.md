# BPL-DREAM 11

## Project Description
**BPL-DREAM 11** is a dynamic and interactive React-based web application that allows users to build their own cricket team. Users can select players, manage their team budget, and view player detailsâ€”all through a responsive UI that matches the design in Figma. This project showcases the use of JSON data to display player information and includes various features to enhance the team selection experience.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js** for building the interactive user interface
- **Tailwind CSS (Daisy-Ui a component library)** for styling components
- **React-Toastify** for notifications
- **Vite** as the build tool

## Key Features
1. **Player Management**: Select and manage players for your team, with real-time coin tracking and availability toggles.
2. **Intuitive UI Components**: Easily navigate between available and selected players with buttons that display player counts and selection statuses.
3. **Validation & Notification**: React-Toastify provides user feedback, while in-app validations prevent over-selection and duplicate picks.
